This repository outlines the organizational procedure that scans software projects for softwrae vulnerabilities and open source software licenses. After the developer submits a software project package to the scanning process, the scanning process checks the software project package for open source licenses and software vulnerabilities. The scanning process then shows the results to the developer submitting the software package, and stores the software vulnerability and license results in an internal database. Results are stored in the internal database to allow corporate managers to implement and enforce policies, and allows developers to review past submissions. 

There are two main goals for the process outlined in this repository: 1) to ensure organization's vulnerability and license policies are enforced while developing software projects; and 2) allow managers view license and vulnerabilities of projects in development, and update policy accordingly.

Tracking open source licenses and software vulnerabilities are important to the organization for two main reasions: 1) protect the organization from legal issues by following open source license software agreements, and avoid open source license agreements that go against organizational and project goals; and 2) manage software vulnerabilities according to organizational and project acceptance levels to protect organization's reputation and future maintenance costs.
