Title: Scan Vulnerability and License Information 

Primary Actor: Corporate Developer

Goal in Context: The developer is able to query project information against NIST vulnerability database to ensure no vulnerabilities exist within the software being developed. 
The developer is also able to submit project information to know the open source software license being used with the current project.
Both the license and the vulnerability information obtained by the developer will be stored in the internal Vulnerability & License result database for the developer or manager to access later.

Stakeholders: 
  Corporate Manager: To be able to oversee corporate developer's progress on the project, and ensure developer is complying with license and vulnerability policy
  Corporate Developer: Provide vulnerability & license information on the project currently working on, and make decisions based on corporate policy based on results.
  Project Owner: To be aware of legal and security problems with the project (transparency), and make decisions based on the information

Preconditions: 
  The developer has a software package/project to submit to the Manage Software Information process
  The Manage Software Information process has access to the NIST database and the OSS scanner to provide results 
  
Main Success Scenario: The developer recieves the license and vulnerability results from the project software package, and the results are stored in an internal result database for future access.

Failed End Conditions: Process recieves inaccurate or fails to deliver vulnerability and license information.
Process fails to store the results in the internal Vulnerability & License result result database.

Trigger: Corporate developer submits the project software package to the Manage Software Information process
